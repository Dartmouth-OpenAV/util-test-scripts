# util-test-scripts
scripts for testing microservices in batch (Dartmouth-specific device names, and edited to whatever test we last did)

These are really just examples of how to do such things, and we generally change them for whatever testing need is at hand.  Another way to test such things is using Postman or Insomnia, but using a script allows one to run loops and sequences repeatedly with pauses provided by sleep if needed.
